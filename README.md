# Notepad: Python

A `"""fun"""` Python challenge where you're only allowed to write code using Windows Notepad.

## 🧠 The Rules
- All code must be written in **Microsoft Notepad**
- **Line wrap off**
- Save as `.txt`, rename to `.py` when running, then back again
- No autocomplete, no external tools, **code from memory**
- Bonus: Try not running it until you're done (Hardcore Mode™)
