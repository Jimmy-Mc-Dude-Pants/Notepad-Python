# 📝 Notepad: Python

A `"""fun"""` Python challenge where you're only allowed to write code using Windows Notepad.

---

## 💡 What This Project Does

This is a challenge that dares you to write real, working Python programs using **only Microsoft Notepad**—no IDEs, no syntax highlighting, no help. Just you, the snake, and your ability to remember basic syntax.

---

## 🎯 Target Audience

- Beginner Python coders who want a brutal (but rewarding) way to master syntax.
- Experienced devs who enjoy masochistic side quests.
- Anyone nostalgic for the early, text-editor-only days of coding.

## 🔍 How It Differs from Other Projects

Most coding challenges are about *what* you build.  
**Notepad: Python** is about *how* you build it—specifically, with the absolute minimum possible tooling.

It’s not about convenience. It’s about survival.

---

## 🧠 The Rules

- All code must be written in **Microsoft Notepad**
- **Line wrap off** (for readability and pain)
- Save as `.txt`, rename to `.py` to run, then rename back
- No autocomplete, no external tools—code from memory
- Bonus Mode: Don’t run the file until you *think* it’s done 😈
